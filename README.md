This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: creating a dangling reference to a vector element.  The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code.  `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version. This issue arises because the vector's internal memory layout can change when elements are added after creating references to existing elements. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution typically involves careful handling of references or using techniques that prevent invalid references such as cloning the value or avoiding mutation after referencing.
